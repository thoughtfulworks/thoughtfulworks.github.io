# A brief introduction to NoSQL database

The term "NoSQL" originally meant "non-SQL" but has evolved to mean "not only SQL," reflecting the diverse approaches modern NoSQL databases use for data management, retrieval, and storing. A database is typically classified as a NoSQL database based on several key characteristics that differentiate it from traditional relational database systems (shortly referred as RDBMS). These characteristics cater to the needs of modern applications requiring scalability, flexibility, and the ability to handle large volumes of *structured*, *semi-structured*, and *unstructured data*.

Here are the core qualities that qualify a database as a NoSQL database:

1. **Non-relational or less structured data model**: NoSQL databases are designed to store and manage data in formats other than the traditional table-based structure (with rows and columns) used in relational databases. They can handle structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, making them versatile for various data types, including JSON documents, key-value pairs, wide-column stores[^1], and graphs.

2. **Scalability**: NoSQL databases are built to provide *horizontal scalability*, meaning they can manage increased loads by adding more servers to the database infrastructure. This contrasts with the vertical scaling approach (upgrading a single server's capacity) typical of relational databases, allowing NoSQL systems to handle vast amounts of data and high throughput.

3. **Flexible Schema**: Unlike relational databases that require a predefined schema (structure of the data) that can be *costly to modify*, NoSQL databases allow a *schema-less* or *dynamic schema approach*. This flexibility enables applications to store and combine data of different structures without needing to define and adhere to a rigid schema upfront.

4. **High performance for specific use sases**: Many NoSQL databases are optimized for specific types of data and access patterns, providing high performance for tasks like full-text search, real-time analytics, and handling large volumes of transactions or data streams.

5. **Distributed nature**: NoSQL databases often employ a distributed architecture, distributing data across multiple servers or nodes. This approach enhances the database's availability, fault tolerance, and resilience, as there is no single point of failure.

6. **API access and query language**: NoSQL databases typically provide API access for queries and data manipulation, rather than using a standard query language like SQL. Some NoSQL databases have their own query languages (Cassandra has CQL) that are specialized for their particular data model.

The aforementioned qualities make NoSQL databases a strong option in situations where traditional relational databases might not perform well.

# Handling nested JSON objects

In the ever-evolving world of NoSQL databases, the choice between **MongoDB** and **Cassandra** becomes crucial when dealing with nested or complex JSON objects. MongoDB and Cassandra offer different approaches due to their underlying data models and architectures. The efficiency of read and write operations in these databases is significantly influenced by how they handle such data structures. Whether we're building a real-time analytics engine, or any application requiring efficient storage and retrieval of complex JSON data, understanding the strengths and limitations of each database system will empower us to make an informed decision.

## MongoDB

- **Native Support**: MongoDB is designed as a document-oriented database, making it inherently well-suited for storing, reading, and writing nested JSON objects. It stores data in BSON (Binary JSON) format, which can naturally represent complex, hierarchical data structures with nested objects and arrays.
- **Querying**: MongoDB provides powerful querying capabilities for nested objects and arrays, including the ability to project specific elements of an array, match against elements of nested documents, and perform aggregations. This makes it easy to work with complex data structures without requiring significant data transformation.
- **Indexing**: MongoDB supports indexing on nested fields, which can significantly improve the performance of read operations involving complex JSON data.

## Cassandra

- **Data Modeling**: Cassandra is a wide-column store, which does not natively store data in a nested JSON format. Instead, complex data structures must be mapped to Cassandra's table structure, often involving denormalization or the use of user-defined types (UDTs) for nested objects. This requires careful data modeling to ensure efficiency.
- **Read and Write Operations**: While Cassandra can efficiently handle high write and read throughput, the efficiency of operations involving nested JSON objects depends heavily on the data model. Well-designed tables can support efficient reads by minimizing the need for joins (which Cassandra does not support) and leveraging partition keys and clustering columns for fast data retrieval.
- **Support for JSON**: Cassandra does offer JSON support for inserting and retrieving data, allowing developers to insert data in JSON format and retrieve data as JSON. However, this does not change the underlying storage model but can simplify working with JSON data.

## Which one to choose?

- **For applications primarily dealing with nested JSON data**: MongoDB is generally better suited and often recommended for applications that frequently store, read, and manipulate nested JSON objects. Its document model, combined with powerful querying, indexing, and aggregation capabilities, makes it highly efficient for working with complex data structures.
- **Considerations beyond nested JSON**: While MongoDB is more naturally aligned with nested JSON data, the choice between MongoDB and Cassandra should also consider other factors such as scalability, data distribution, and consistency requirements. Cassandra might be preferred in scenarios requiring linear scalability across multiple data centers or when write throughput and availability are prioritized.

[^1]: **Wide-column store databases**: Wide-column store databases are a type of NoSQL database that organizes data into tables, rows, and "dynamic" columns. Dynamic columns enable each row can have a different set of columns. Unlike traditional relational databases that structure data into fixed columns and rows, wide-column stores allow each row to have a unique or different set of columns. **Use Cases**: Ideal for handling large datasets with variable schema across many rows, such as time-series data, or for applications requiring high performance and scalability, like web analytics and real-time sensor data analysis.
